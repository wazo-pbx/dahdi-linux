The firmware downloaders are extra kernel objects that are now required for
the Hardware echo canceller support in some Digium cards (wctdm24xxp,
wcte12xp). They are downloaded at build time. The makefile will build 
with support for them if they were indeed downloaded.

This patch removes this downloading and thus keeps those modules 
DFSG-compliant. Unlike the Digium firmwares, this is a compile-time 
decision and hence cannot be reverted once a dahdi-modules package is
built.
